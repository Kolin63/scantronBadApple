# üçé Bad Apple on a Scantron
I was really bored during one of my midterms because it was a long scantron. I was staring at my answers, and I thought, "Huh. I want to make Bad Apple on this." 

So I wrote some Python using MoviePy to read from a video file of Bad Apple and downscale it to the size of a 100-question Scantron sheet.
